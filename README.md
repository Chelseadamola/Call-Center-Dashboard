# World Call Center Data Analysis
{Dashbaord}(call center dashboard.png)
This repository contains the code for my first-ever data analytics project completed with Microsoft Excel. The project involved analyzing a fake world call center data using various charts and slicers. The charts helped to visualize call trends, reason for calling, channel of calling, state, and response time. The slicers provided an interactive experience for dissecting the information.
### Technologies Used
•	Microsoft Excel
### Files in this Repository
•	callcenterdashboard.xlsx: the Excel file containing the data and analysis for the project.
•	README.md: this file, describing the project and its contents.
