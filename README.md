# Fake World Call Center Data Analysis

[]("Call-Center-Dashboard.png")

This repository contains the code for my first-ever data analytics project completed with Microsoft Excel. The project involved analyzing a fake world call center data using various charts and slicers. The charts helped to visualize call trends, reason for calling, channel of calling, state, and response time. The slicers provided an interactive experience for dissecting the information.
